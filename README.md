Classifier algorithms in artificial intelligence are used to categorize input data into different classes or categories based on certain features or characteristics. These algorithms learn patterns from labeled training data and use that learning to classify new, unlabeled data into predefined classes.

The primary function of classifier algorithms is to predict the class or category of a given input based on its features. These algorithms can work with various types of data, such as images, text, numerical data, etc.
